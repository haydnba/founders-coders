							<h3>Photography</h3>
							<p>I have been involved with photography and digital imaging for around 20 years.</p>
							<ul>
								<li><p>I teach two short evening courses at the City of Wesminster College in paddington: <a href="http://www.cwc.ac.uk/Courses/Pages/Photographic-Studio-Lighting.aspx" target="blank">Studio Photography</a> (an introduction to studio lighting theory and practice) and <a href="http://www.cwc.ac.uk/Courses/Pages/AAE06VV.aspx" target="blank">Introduction to Photoshop</a>.</p><p><strong>I completed an Award (C&amp;G) in Education and Training with CWC last summer.</strong></p></li>
								<li><p>I review books on photography and history of photography for the <a href="http://www.burlington.org.uk/" target="blank">Burlington Magazine</a>.</p></li>
								<li><p>I regularly work as a production assistant on film and photo shoots and I used to work as a photographer's assistant and darkroom technician.</p></li>
							</ul>
							<p>While I really loved working in the darkroom with black and white processing, I have developed a strong interest in digital imaging and I hope to learn more about image processing and computer vision as I develop my computing skills (see my codewars kata <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/bit-plane-return/train/javascript" target="blank">Bit Plan Return</a>. </p>

							<h3>Philosophy, Art History etc.</h3>
							<p>After studying photography at college (BTEC) I took a degree in Art History at Goldsmiths College. Through my reading in the history of art I came into contact with philosophy and theory. After my degree I really wanted to stay involved in reading and discussing philosophy and theory and eventually I found a project that I could really get involved with: <a href="https://sltphilosophy.com/" target="blank">The Philosophy Forum</a>. This is a philosophical discussion group for Islington residents with mental health problems. After attending as a discussion facilitator for 5 years I am now the main organiser for this project.</p>

							<h3>Food &amp; Cooking</h3>
							<p>For the last 6 years I have managed the kitchen at <a href="http://sfts.org.uk/" target="blank">Shelter From the Storm</a> on Tuesday nights. SFTS is the only night shelter in London that is open year-round. My friends and I use our long experience working in catering and the service industry making sure that the 40-50 homeless guests that stay there each night are well fed. Normally it is extremely fun and definitely not as stressful as working in professional catering or service industry.</p>

							<h3>Trees &amp; Gardens etc.</h3>
							<p>I have worked as an arborist's assistant for many years (<a href="http://www.orangetrees.net/" target="blank">Orange Trees</a>), managing the situation on the ground and working with hand-tools in the trees. And through this work I have taken on a number of clients around London for whom I work as a gardener.</p>

							<h3>Computing</h3>
							<p>I became interested in computing a few years ago when I was volunteering as a classroom and learning assistant for Morley College in Lambeth. I was assigned to a computing class for absolute beginners and the tutor advised me to look into taking some courses in programming. In particular, she pointed me in the direction of <a href="https://www.elatt.org.uk/" target="blank">ELATT</a>, where she had recently been learning web design. I took a L1. Award in computing (web development) and then the L2. Award and Dimploma the next year. Some key areas/projects covered include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>HTML, CSS, UX, UI</li>
									<li>Basic JavaScript</li>
									<li>Programming with PHP and MySQL:<br>project was to design and implement a content management system from scratch.</li>
									<li>Relational Database Theory</li>
									<li>Wordpress</li>
									<li>Photoshop, Dreamweaver etc.</li>
									<li>Agile development</li>
								</ul>
							<p>Subsequent to taking this course I have continued to practice my programming and to work on projects with/for friends - most recently learning to program in python and use the Django framework.</p>
