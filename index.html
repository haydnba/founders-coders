							<h3>Photography</h3>
							<p>I have been involved with photography and digital imaging for around 20 years.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>I teach two short evening courses at the City of Wesminster College in paddington: <a href="http://www.cwc.ac.uk/Courses/Pages/Photographic-Studio-Lighting.aspx" target="blank">Studio Photography</a> (an introduction to studio lighting theory and practice) and <a href="http://www.cwc.ac.uk/Courses/Pages/AAE06VV.aspx" target="blank">Introduction to Photoshop</a>.</li>
								<li>I review books on photography and history of photography for the <a href="http://www.burlington.org.uk/" target="blank">Burlington Magazine</a>.</li>
								<li>I have worked as both production and photographer's assistant on film and photo shoots and as a darkroom technician.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>While I really loved working in the darkroom with black and white processing, I have developed a strong interest in digital imaging and I hope to learn more about image processing and computer vision as I develop my computing skills (see my codewars kata <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/bit-plane-return/train/javascript" target="blank">Bit Plane Return</a>. </p>

							<h3>Philosophy etc.</h3>
							<p>After studying photography at college (BTEC) I took a degree in Art History at Goldsmiths College. At university I came into contact with philosophy and theory and began to focus almost exclusively on these fields. In order to remain involved in the subjects after my degree I began participating in a charitable project called <a href="https://sltphilosophy.com/" target="blank">The Philosophy Forum</a>. This is a philosophical discussion group for Islington residents with mental health problems (organised by the <a href="https://www.slt.org.uk/" target="blank">Stuart Low Trust</a>). After attending as a discussion facilitator for 5 years I am now the key organiser for this project, in which capacity I am tasked with:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Managing the project website and other digital resources</li>
								<li>Maintaining a team of volunteer facilitators</li>
								<li>Looking after our participants, all of whom are vulnerable adults</li>
								<li>Giving presentations on philosophical topics etc.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>I really love this work and we are currently expanding the project to work in other areas of london and with other charities.</p>
							<p>I am a regular participant in and contributor to the philosophical research/discussion programme at the <a href="http://www.pa-f.net/" target="blank">Performing Arts Forum</a> in Northern France.</p>
							<p>I teach a 10 week course in <a href="http://www.cwc.ac.uk/Courses/Pages/Art-History-for-Beginners.aspx" target="blank">Art History</a> at CWC and I taught the subject at Foundation Degree level at Hastings College of Art &amp; Technology (2007-8).</p>

							<h3>Computing</h3>
							<p>I became interested in computing a few years ago when I was volunteering as a classroom and learning assistant for Morley College in Lambeth. I was assigned to a computing class for absolute beginners and the tutor advised me to look into taking some courses in programming. In particular, she pointed me in the direction of <a href="https://www.elatt.org.uk/" target="blank">ELATT</a>, where she had recently been learning web design. I took a L1. Award in computing (web development) and then the L2. Award and Dimploma the next year. Some key areas/projects covered include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>HTML, CSS, UX, UI</li>
									<li>Basic JavaScript</li>
									<li>Programming with PHP and MySQL:<br>project was to design and implement a content management system from scratch.</li>
									<li>Relational Database Theory</li>
									<li>Wordpress</li>
									<li>Photoshop, Dreamweaver etc.</li>
									<li>Agile development</li>
								</ul>
							<p>Subsequent to taking this course I have continued to practice programming and to work on projects with/for friends - most recently learning to program in python and use the Django framework.</p>

							<h3>Other Interests</h3>
							<p>For the last 6 years my partner and I have managed the kitchen at <a href="http://sfts.org.uk/" target="blank">Shelter From The Storm</a> on Tuesday nights. SFTS is the only night shelter in London that is open year-round. My friends and I use our long experience working in catering and the service industry making sure that the 40-50 homeless guests that stay there each night are well fed. Normally it is extremely fun, especially compared to cooking and serving professionally.</p>
							<p>I also work a lot as a handyman, decorator, gardener and as an assistant to a tree surgeon. I really enjoy practical work, making things, and trees...</p>
